# alibi

alibi is a web shell, which is a type of malicious script used by attackers to remotely manage a server via a web interface. it's important to note that using such a script on a server can pose a serious security risk, as it allows anyone who can access the script to perform potentially destructive operations on the server.

## how to upload the script to a server

you would typically need FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access or some other form of file management access to the server. this could be through a hosting control panel like cPanel, or a cloud service's dashboard like AWS Management Console.

1. upload the script: using your FTP client or file manager, upload the alibi.php file to a directory on the server. the exact location would depend on the server's configuration and your needs. for a typical web server, you might upload it to the public HTML directory (often named public_html, www, or htdocs).

2. access the script: once the script is uploaded, you can access it via a web browser by navigating to the URL corresponding to the location of the script. for example, if you uploaded the script to the root of the public HTML directory for a website at www.example.com, you would access the script at http://www.example.com/mini_shell.php.

the script does not run automatically. it only runs when accessed via a web browser. each time you navigate to the script's URL, the server executes the script and sends the output (the HTML interface of the web shell) to your browser.

## step-by-step breakdown of how the script works and how it can be used:

1. running the script: the script is typically uploaded to a server and then accessed via a web browser. the exact URL would depend on where the script is located on the server.

2. file upload: The script provides a form for uploading files to the server. The uploaded file is saved in the current directory.

3. file + directory listing: the script lists all files and directories in the current directory. each file and directory is displayed with its name, size, permissions, and a set of options.

4. file viewing: if a file is selected, the script displays the contents of the file.

5. file operations: the script provides several options for each file and directory:

- delete: deletes the file or directory.
- chmod: changes the permissions of the file or directory. the new permissions are provided as a four-digit octal number.
- rename: renames the file or directory. the new name is provided in a text field.
- edit: edits the contents of the file. the new contents are provided in a text area.

6. navigation: the script displays the current path at the top of the page. each part of the path is a link that can be clicked to navigate to that directory.

the script can be used for various purposes, such as uploading files to the server, editing existing files, changing file permissions, and so on.

please note that using such a script on a server can pose a serious security risk, as it allows anyone who can access the script to perform potentially destructive operations on the server. it's typically used for malicious purposes, such as gaining unauthorized access to a server.
